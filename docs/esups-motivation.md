# Motivation for the STOCKHOLM Platform

In this comprehensive case study, students will delve into the strategic and operational efforts of the Emergency Supply Pre-positioning Strategy (ESUPS), a collaborative working group consisting of Member States, NGOs, academics, UN agencies, and regional organizations, all operating within Welthungerhilfe. ESUPS plays a critical role in logistics preparedness and pre-positioning at both strategic and operational levels, aiming to optimize the pre-positioning of disaster relief items, minimize relief response times, and enhance the mapping and analysis of relief stock across global humanitarian organizations.

## Overview of ESUPS and STOCKHOLM

ESUPS has developed an innovative platform called STOCKHOLM (STOCK of Humanitarian Organizations Logistics Mapping), which serves as a global central repository for relief stock data. This platform visually maps warehouse and supply locations, and provides an in-depth analysis that helps improve response times and supply coverage across diverse humanitarian crises.

## The Crisis that Prompted This Work: Disaster Relief & Mobilization Efforts

In 2015, Kathmandu, Nepal was devastated by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake that claimed approximately 9,000 lives and injured thousands more. The full extent of the tragedy became evident hours later, as over 600,000 buildings lay in ruins, including the nation’s central disaster relief supplies. Despite being only the 31st most affected area, Kathmandu housed around 90% of Nepal’s disaster relief resources, which were buried under the debris.

The international community quickly mobilized, with the UN raising nearly $330 million within two weeks to assist Nepal. While this rapid response showcased global solidarity and compassion, it also underscored a critical issue: the aid came after the disaster had struck. In disaster scenarios, the first 24 hours are crucial for rescue operations, as chances of finding survivors diminish significantly after that period. No amount of money can turn back those critical hours.

International responses, though well-intentioned, often face coordination challenges and logistical delays. The complexity of involving multiple organizations can lead to miscommunication and inefficiencies, making it difficult to ascertain what aid is coming and in what quantities. Studies indicate that roughly 60-80% of all disaster response costs are logistics-related, including stock pre-positioning and deployment. Knowing the location and availability of supplies is crucial to optimizing response efforts.

## The Origin of ESUPS 

Enter ESUPS (Emergency Supply Pre-positioning Strategy). Founded in 2016, ESUPS emerged from the recognition that effective disaster response requires more than just post-disaster fundraising—it necessitates proactive, strategic planning and resource allocation. Initially launched as a collaborative effort among several NGOs, ESUPS aimed to tackle the very issues that hampered the Nepal earthquake response by creating a global database of pre-positioned supplies. This innovative initiative ensures that the nearest available resources are utilized first, enabling aid organizations to make informed decisions and address the most urgent needs swiftly.

ESUPS started as a modest project, built on a simple spreadsheet that cataloged available disaster relief supplies across various regions. However, as the project gained traction and more organizations began contributing data, it became clear that a more sophisticated approach was needed. In response, ESUPS partnered with academic institutions like Penn State University and MIT, as well as industry leaders such as Gurobi, to develop advanced models for optimizing the allocation and movement of these supplies.

One of ESUPS’ early successes was the development of a simulation model that could identify the optimal locations for pre-positioning disaster relief supplies. This model proved instrumental in reducing response times and ensuring that critical resources reached disaster zones faster and more efficiently. Over time, ESUPS expanded its database to include hundreds of NGOs, each contributing data that made the system more robust and comprehensive. The impact of this collaborative effort was soon evident, as ESUPS’ models helped improve response times in several subsequent disaster scenarios.

By 2020, ESUPS had grown into a globally recognized initiative, with its strategies being adopted by numerous international aid organizations. The project’s achievements include not only the development of cutting-edge optimization models, but also the successful implementation of these models in real-world disaster scenarios. ESUPS has been credited with significantly enhancing the effectiveness of disaster relief efforts, saving lives, and reducing the costs associated with disaster response logistics.

## ESUPS Today

Today, ESUPS continues to lead the way in disaster preparedness, leveraging the latest technological advancements and fostering collaboration between NGOs, academia, and the private sector. Its success story is a testament to the power of data-driven decision-making and the importance of pre-positioning strategies in disaster relief. As ESUPS looks to the future, its focus remains on refining its models, expanding its global reach, and continuing to make a tangible difference in the lives of those affected by disasters.
